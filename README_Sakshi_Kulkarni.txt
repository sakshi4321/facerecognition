Hello,
image 1,2,3 are images of people and 4,5,6 are different images of the same people which were detected by the algorithm.
Since i have used a pretrained model,the weights could not be attached with the files and hence ,this is the link for the weights.
->https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace/tree/master/weights
The file was not able to fit in the size limit hence it coulld not be attached.I regret the inconvinience caused.
I have used this approach considering the YOLO approach .I have used the triple loss function as it increases the accuracy of the algorithm and supports the YOLO approach which is one of the most practical approach in today's world.
